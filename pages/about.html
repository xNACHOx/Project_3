          <h2>Welcome! My name is Necho Webster and this is my website that I have built from scratch. It took me a long time to build this site so if you're here to hack it or break it please dont because I will find you. Anyways-- I am a senior at LSU studying mostly graphic design with a minor in theater. I've grown to love art over the years especially digital art so I chose a path that would be best for the direction the world is going towards, that being technology is the future. I love rock music and being outdoors and I hope to go to more concerts when I graduate from college since I'm always bogged down by schoolwork. I have a lot of varying ambitions but one day I hope to make my own brand whether it be related to clothing, technology, art or some weird collection of million dollar NFT's. I truly have no idea where I am headed in life as of right now but I believe that whatever I choose to pursue I will do it because it makes me happy. That's my whole speil, tata for now. Oh, and go check out some of my work.</h2>
